   ><p>Various U.S State officials say when it comes to hazardous air quality, wildfires are one of the main causes of unhealthy days, very unhealthy days, and hazardous air quality index (AQI) days.</p> 

<p>The <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/usa">U.S Air Quality Index</a> (AQI) is a scale used by government agencies to communicate to the public the level of pollution present in the air. AQI is used to help people know how the local air quality is going to impact their overall health.</p> 

<p>According to <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/air-pollution/">NASA</a>, air pollution and concerning AQI days are caused by a variety of factors that contain aerosols. Aerosols are categorized as solid and liquid particles that are harmful to the planet and to the population’s overall health. 
</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-10">
    <p>“These particles [aresols] can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes, and wildfires,” said officials at <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/air-pollution/">NASA</a>. Keeping track of these aerosols through the measuring of various AQI days is an important step in monitoring the health of our country.</p> 

<p>In 2021, the <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> reported 557 concerning (sum of unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous days) AQI days spanning the various counties in all 50 states.</p> 

<p>Among these 557 concerning AQI days, the states that presented the highest number of days in 2021 were California, Montana, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada. Combined these states averaged 127 concerning AQI days in 2021.

    <p>These five states also reported some of the highest numbers in the U.S for wildfires in 2021. According to the <a href="https://www.nifc.gov/"> National Interagency Fire Center</a> (NIFC), California, Montana, Arizona, Texas, and Nevada had a combined sum of almost 20,000 wildfires in 2021.</p>

<p>Examining the state of California which experienced around 9,000 wildfires in 2021, correspondingly, California was also a top contender for the highest number of unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous AQI days totaling a sum of 205 concerning AQI days in 2021.

  <div class="col-sm-10">Similarly, Montana also experienced a high volume of wildfires and a large total of consequential AQI days. The data presented in the map above is taken from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/"> United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, however, after source gathering and further data research, it is concluded that this data is falsely presented for Montana. In 2021, Montana experienced 208 unhealthy AQI days and 50 very unhealthy days in combination with a total of almost 3,000 wildfires.</div>

    <p>Air Quality Modeler from the <a href="https://deq.mt.gov/">Montana Department of Environmental Quality</a>, Brandon McGuire, said that there is a strong correlation between wildfire smoke and concerning AQI days. </p>
<p>“These pretty massive fires that seem uncontainable, are definitely correlated to the idea that if there are fewer fires, there will be less smoke and less consequential AQI days,” said McGuire.</p>

<p>One of the main ways to decrease consequential AQI days is by quickly containing wildfires. If environmental factors that contain aerosols are eliminated, the number of unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous AQI days will decrease.</p> 

<p>Decreasing the number of consequential AQI days is important when taking into account the health of the public. Smoke from wildfires that cause unhealthy AQI days can harm citizens by particularly compromising immune, lung, and heart systems. McGuire said when people in “at-risk” categories are confined due to unhealthy AQI days, more health concerns are often presented.</p>

<p>“Populations that are more at risk are recommended to limit their outdoor activity during concerning AQI days,” said McGuire. 
</p>

  <div class="col-sm-10">
    <p>While McGuire can attest to the general health within the state of Montana, other states that frequent wildfires such as Arizona, Texas, and Nevada have also reported a decline in the overall health of their population during unhealthy AQI days.</p> 

<p>In order to bring down the number of unhealthy, very unhealthy, and hazardous AQI days, wildfires need to be contained more quickly. If smoke has less of a chance to spread, the air quality will not be affected as greatly and the AQI will remain in good standing.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by advancing more resources to quickly put out wildfires, evaluating wildfire season in a higher detailed manner, and prioritizing good AQI days. Summer tends to be the time of year when wildfires are most frequent. High temperatures and fast winds can cause uncontrollable fires that severely increase the AQI for any given day. Mcguire added that in the summer, there is even higher coordination between unhealthy AQI days and wildfires.</p>

<p>“The summer has a lot of days impacted by smoke. There is a direct correlation with wildfires and we look at that in great detail,” said McGuire.</p>

<p>Air quality modelers and specialists continue to measure and report on AQI data in relation to wildfires and other natural causes that contribute to pollution, but this time also needs to be allocated for implementing solutions that will decrease the number of consequential AQI days.</p>

<p>In order to create a healthier air climate and improve the general health of populations, McGuire said that air quality control centers need to start prioritizing hands-on programs that ensure the declination of unhealthy AQI days.
